## ABOUT

The Satellite Finder project is a web application designed to help users find information about satellites based on various criteria, such as country code, orbit code, and object type. It allows users to explore and search for satellite details in a user-friendly and interactive interface.


### SETUP
To run the Satellite Finder project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the project repository to your local machine.
- Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
- Ensure you have a compatible web browser installed (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.).
- The project utilizes JavaScript (JS) and Tailwind CSS, so make sure you have a  stable internet connection to load external resources.
- Run a local development server (for example, using Live Server in Visual Studio Code) to view the project in your browser.

- index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- src/: This folder contains subfolders for CSS and JS resources.
